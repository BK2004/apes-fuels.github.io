                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Oil is a fossil fuel that comes from underground reservoirs in the form of crude oil.
                    That crude oil forms over millions of years through the decomposition of organic material.
                    The first oil was discovered by the Chinese in 600 B.C.
                    However, it didn’t become a staple of the economy until its finding by Edwin Drake and the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company in 1855.
                    That company was renamed to Seneca Oil Company, but by 1870, John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil had gone on to establish a monopoly over the oil industry,
                    controlling 80% of the market. Oil soon lost its need in the household with the introduction of electricity, but it became widely relied-upon for automobiles.
                    In 1909, Standard Oil was broken up into 34 different companies by antitrust laws, but 3 of them went on to control the market along
                    with 4 separate international companies, becoming the “Seven Sisters.”
                    After WWII, oil nations began to take control over oil companies, and oil became a common cause of frustration
                    due to prices that were, and continue to be, affected harshly by politics and wars.

                    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
                    <p>Crude oil is first drilled from the ground before being refined into usable oil.
                    From there, it can be used to heat homes, combusted in automobile engines to provide energy to the vehicles, or burned at power plants 
                    to generate electricity.</p>

                    <p>Nuclear fusion is the process by which two atomic nuclei combine and release large amounts of energy when doing so.
                        In <em>Internal Constitution of the Stars</em>, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington theorized that stars produce
                        their energy through the fusion of hydrogen into helium. In 1934, Ernest Rutherford, otherwise known as the “father of Nuclear Physics,” 
                        demonstrated the fusion of deuterium into helium for the first time in a lab, finding a huge output, with the help of his assistant, 
                        who discovered tritium, a hydrogen isotope, and helium-3, a rare helium isotope. Soon, in the 1950s, 
                        Soviet scientists proposed design concepts for the tokamak, a nuclear fusion machine that would confine plasma for long 
                        enough to reach conditions suitable for fusion in a process known as magnetic confinement fusion. In 1983, a European collaboration produced the 
                        Joint European Torus (JET), which was at the time the largest working magnetic confinement fusion experiment. 
                        In 1997, JET managed to create an output of 16 MW from an input of 24 MW. Soon, the location and details of ITER, (“The Way”) in Latin, 
                        an international fusion collaboration by 35 different countries with a goal of producing 500 MW from 50 MW. 
                        Now, construction on the project is about 78% completed.
